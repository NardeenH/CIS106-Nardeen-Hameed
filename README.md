## Assignment 1

I am taking this course for two reasons. First, I've loved computer programming since my childhood. It was my dream to be a computer science engineer, and I see it is time to take this course. Also, I want to get more programming language skills because there are many opportunities for a successful career. Second, I don't like to communicate with people and always like to be home and work from home; however, there are many careers for programming that I can work from home. In addition, the IT career is very popular now. It will be more demand for IT in the future because everything will be computerized.

## Assignment 2
I choose the Python programming language to learn for many reasons. First of all, Python is easier to learn the basics and understand the Python code. Second, Python is one of the most requested programming languages in the programming field. Third, there are many job opportunities in the field of Python language. Finally, Python contains a simple and uncomplicated set of sentences and simple words written in English.
 I intend to use Python for audio application development between hearing aid, cochlear implant devices, and applications. Also, I intend to work from home. There are many work-from-home opportunities that are available in Python. I tested Wikiversity web for all IDEs found. I would like to start with GDB and Thonny in the beginning.

## Assignment 3
During this session, I learned that all programs need planning and patience to solve problems. Programming teaches you to see problems in the light of solutions. For every problem you may encounter, you will brainstorm how to solve it. The results that come from brainstorming and problem solving will give you a positive outlook and empower you to work on the problem no matter how difficult it may be. Programming is a highly sought-after job for people who want to balance their work and family life. Some people feel that going to work is a waste of time; however, programming will allow them to apply for many jobs available around the world without moving to the workplace or traveling abroad. Therefore, programming is fundamental today and maybe even more influential in the future. This field will continue to grow as programmers around the world work to learn new ways to communicate with machines and computers.
