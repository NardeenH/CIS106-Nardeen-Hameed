# CIS106-Nardeen-Hameed

## Assignment 1

I am taking this course for two reasons. First, I've loved computer programming since my childhood. It was my dream to be a computer science engineer, and I see it is time to take this course. Also, I want to get more programming language skills because there are many opportunities for a successful career. Second, I don't like to communicate with people and always like to be home and work from home; however, there are many careers for programming that I can work from home. In addition, the IT career is very popular now. It will be more demand for IT in the future because everything will be computerized.

## Assignment 2
I choose the Python programming language to learn for many reasons. First of all, Python is easier to learn the basics and understand the Python code. Second, Python is one of the most requested programming languages in the programming field. Third, there are many job opportunities in the field of Python language. Finally, Python contains a simple and uncomplicated set of sentences and simple words written in English.
 I intend to use Python for audio application development between hearing aid, cochlear implant devices, and applications. Also, I intend to work from home. There are many work-from-home opportunities that are available in Python. I tested Wikiversity web for all IDEs found. I would like to start with GDB and Thonny in the beginning.
 
## Assignment 3
During this session, I learned that all programs need planning and patience to solve problems. Programming teaches you to see problems in the light of solutions. For every problem you may encounter, you will brainstorm how to solve it. The results that come from brainstorming and problem solving will give you a positive outlook and empower you to work on the problem no matter how difficult it may be. Programming is a highly sought-after job for people who want to balance their work and family life. Some people feel that going to work is a waste of time; however, programming will allow them to apply for many jobs available around the world without moving to the workplace or traveling abroad. Therefore, programming is fundamental today and maybe even more influential in the future. This field will continue to grow as programmers around the world work to learn new ways to communicate with machines and computers.

## Assignment 4
This session was more challenging than the previous one. And I learned how to use the flowchart to solve simple problems. Yes, I found it difficult to solve errors in my dependency code. However, challenge yourself and be patient; you will find a solution. I intend to apply this science in my world to create applications and programs to facilitate life. I want to develop projects and applications in the virtual world, which is gaming technology and social networking. As for the application of this learning in work, many applications exist in our lives that need to be corrected and developed. For example, the development of voice translation software is needed by the deaf. Programming is the most influential language in various industries, transforming the virtual world in industry, commerce, education, and social communication. Therefore, programming remains an area of greatest need.

## Assignment 5
In this session, I learned to enter function parameters into a flowchart, which made me think about introducing new parameters into old applications that can be transformed into newer ones. For example, there is a particular game, like the Mario game; through function parameters, we can add things to this game to develop and make it better than it was.
There is another reason why I entered the programming world. I do not like to go to the doctor every three months to program my hearing aids. Maybe after I learn how to program, I can program my hearing aid by myself. Also, I would like to create new applications that work for hearing aid or cochlear implant device to make life easier.

## Assignment 6
In this session, I learned how to write good code. Writing specific code requires a lot of time and mastery until the result comes out as you want. Programming became another science subject, requiring diligence and continued learning in school. I intend to learn to program very well, and I would like to apply this learning to developing the web. Also, I want to create programs to help people who have hearing loss. Programming is the most influential language in various industries, transforming the virtual world in industry, commerce, education, and social communication. Therefore, programming remains an area of greatest need.
