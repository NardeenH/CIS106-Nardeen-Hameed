# CIS106-Nardeen-Hameed
I am taking this course for two reasons. First, I've loved computer programming since my childhood. It was my dream to be a computer science engineer, and I see it is time to take this course. Also, I want to get more programming language skills because there are many opportunities for a successful career. Second, I don't like to communicate with people and always like to be home and work from home; however, there are many careers for programming that I can work from home. In addition, the IT career is very popular now. It will be more demand for IT in the future because everything will be computerized.
